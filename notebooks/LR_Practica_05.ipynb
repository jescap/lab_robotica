    "In this practical session, we present a robotics challenge for the students, focusing on implementing autonomous navigation using the Turtlebot 3 robot. The ultimate objective is to build a ROS package capable of managing the robot's autonomous navigation in an environment with obstacles. This initial session will concentrate on reactive local navigation, where the robot must safely navigate to a given destination while avoiding surrounding obstacles. The task is divided into two parts: 1) controlling the robot to reach a designated waypoint, and 2) enabling the robot to follow a specified path to reach that waypoint.\n",

    "## Coordinate frames \n",
    "\n",
    "ROS robots use multiple coordinate frames to operate. These are used to express coordinates of robot positions, waypoints, paths, and more. The different nodes in a ROS system need to know the existing frames and their relationships in order to transform coordinates properly. To handle this, there is a key package in ROS called `tf`. This package keeps track of multiple coordinate frames over time, maintaining the relationships between them in a tree structure buffered over time and published in the `/tf` topic. The `tf` package also provides functions to transform points, vectors, and other entities between any two coordinate frames at any desired point in time. It also includes tools to visualize the TF tree and other helpful features. For further information, check [here](http://wiki.ros.org/tf).\n",

    "</figure>\n",
    "\n",
    "The main coordinate frames we will use with the Turtlebot robot are the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "+ `/odom`. This is a static frame whose origin $(0,0,0)$ is set at the robot's initial position when it starts. This frame will be used as our _world_ coordinate system. \n",
    "+ `/base_footprint` (or `/base_link`). This is a local frame attached to the robot (that is, it moves with the robot), with the X-axis pointing in the direction of the robot's motion and the Z-axis pointing upwards.\n",
    "+ `base_scan`. This frame is attached to the laser scanner mounted on the robot. \n",

    "</figure>\n",
    "\n",
    "Goal waypoints for the robot will typically be given in world coordinates, e.g., in the `/odom` frame. However, to control the robot’s motion, it may be useful to express the goal in the robot’s local coordinates, which allows us to reason about the linear ($v$) and angular ($\\omega$) velocities needed to reach the destination. In Figure 2, the world frame `/odom` is denoted as $X_G$ and $Y_G$, while the robot’s local frame `/base_link` is denoted as $X_R$ and $Y_R$. The TF library can be used to transform points between coordinate frames, for example, using the `TransformListener` class. This class allows requests to transform data between any two given coordinate frames. The following code snippet, for instance, transforms a point from the `odom` frame to the `base_link` frame:"

    "## Introduction to launch files\n",
    "\n",
    "ROS provides `roslaunch`, a tool for easily launching multiple ROS nodes both locally and remotely (via SSH), as well as for setting parameters on the Parameter Server. It includes options to automatically respawn processes that have died. `roslaunch` uses one or more XML configuration files (with the `.launch` extension) to specify the parameters to set, the nodes to launch, and the machines that they should run on. Running a launch file will start all the nodes specified in the file with the provided parameters. You can start a launch file with the following command: `roslaunch package_name file_name.launch`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The complete syntax for launch files can be checked [here](http://wiki.ros.org/roslaunch/XML). ROS nodes to be executed are included with the `<node>` tag. External arguments to a launch file can be defined using the `<arg>` tag. Other launch files can be included with the `<include>` tag, and their parameters can be set using additional `<arg>` tags. Using the `<param>` tag inside a node, you can define private parameters for that node: `<param name=\"param_name” type=\"\"str|int|double|bool|yaml” value=\"value\" />`. Alternatively, you can load multiple parameters from a YAML file with the following tag: `<rosparam command=”load” file=”PATH/TO/FILE.yaml”>`. \n",
    "\n",
    "The following example launch file would run a Turtlebot3 Gazebo simulation along with a node for teleoperating the robot.

The ultimate objective is to develop a ROS package that enables autonomous navigation for the Turtlebot 3 robot. Our first task will be to implement a local reactive navigation system.

The goal is to design a local controller that can safely navigate the robot to a specified goal, avoiding collisions with surrounding obstacles.\n",

    "Your system should provide velocity commands (both linear and angular) to the robot through the `/cmd_vel` topic, enabling it to navigate toward its goal. To ensure safe navigation, the robot must avoid obstacles, using its onboard 2D laser scanner for detection. This sensor provides readings consisting of a set of distances (ranges) to nearby obstacles, where each entry in the distance vector corresponds to a known angle, forming a set of polar coordinates relative to the sensor’s position. Your system should subscribe to laser scanner readings through the `/scan` topic, receiving messages of type `sensor_msgs::LaserScan`. For more details, see the message documentation [here](https://docs.ros.org/en/noetic/api/sensor_msgs/html/msg/LaserScan.html). The `ranges[]` array provides obstacle distances at different angles, spanning from `angle_min` to `angle_max` in increments of `angle_increment`. \n",

    "+ Path following: In this advanced mode, the robot navigates to its destination by following a given path, i.e., a sequence of discrete waypoints that lead to a final goal (see Figure 4 for an example). For this mode, the system should listen to the `path` topic, receiving messages of [type](https://docs.ros.org/en/noetic/api/nav_msgs/html/msg/Path.html) `nav_msgs/Path`.  \n",
