    "\n",
    "Git is a version control system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later. It is a quite helpful and extended tool to manage source code repositories. The basic concepts are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Git is based on snapshots of the code in a given state, which is given by the author and the date.\n",
    "+ A _commit_ is a set of changes in the files being tracked, which is saved to the Git _repository_ with a unique identifier.\n",
    "+ _Branches_ can be thought of as a timeline starting from commits and allow you to work with multiple chains of commits inside a project. There is always at least one main or predefined branch called _master_.\n",
    "+ _HEAD_ is a pointer to the last commit in the active branch.\n",
    "+ _Remote_ refers to sites that host remote repositories such as GitHub.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Git basic operations\n",
    "\n",
    "__Clone:__ This operation creates the instance of the repository. It checks out all files in the repository in a local working directory. Users can perform many operations with this local repository. The only time networking gets involved is when the repository instances are being synchronized.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Pull:__ This operation copies the changes from a remote repository instance to a local one. The pull operation is used for synchronization between two repository instances. \n",
    "\n",
    "__Add/Commit:__ When you modify files from the working directory, the _add_ command will send the changes to the stage area, which is an intermediate state in which the files to be sent in the commit are stored. Finally, with _commit_, they are sent to the local repository. Git doesn’t track each and every modified file. Whenever you do a commit operation, Git looks for the files present in the staging area. Only those files present in the staging area are considered for commit and not all the modified files.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Push:__ This operation copies changes from a local repository instance to a remote one. This is used to store the changes permanently into the Git repository.  \n",

The line-ending format of text files differs between Windows and Linux. When this option is active, Git automatically adapts the line-ending format of files in the repository based on the operating system. However, even if our repository is on a Windows machine, these files will eventually be used in Linux through a virtual machine. Therefore, they must retain the Linux line-ending format. In any case, you can use the VS Code editor to open a file and check or modify its line-ending format. This setting is displayed in the status bar at the bottom right. CRLF is the line-ending format for Windows, while LF is used for Linux. Ensure that your files use the LF format.\n",

First, [create a GitHub account](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/GitHub-Account-Setup-and-Configuration) and activate two-factor authentication for extra security. We will not use SSH access repositories, so that part can be skipped. Although there are several [authentication methods](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/about-authentication-to-github) to access GitHub repositories, Github is removing password-based authentication in favor of more secure methods. Thus, two-factor authentication in addition to user/password is recommended to access the GitHub web inferface. In order to access GitHub repositories from the CLI, e.g., to push changes, we will use the HTTPS protocol with a personal access token. [Create your personal token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens#creating-a-personal-access-token-classic) for GitHub access and __do not forget to copy your randomly generated personal token in some file, as you'll need it to access repositories__.
