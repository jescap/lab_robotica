ROS is a set of software libraries and tools that help you build robot applications, including hardware drivers, state-of-the-art algorithms, robotics simulators, powerful developer tools, and much more. ROS is open-source and has a strong support from the robotics community, so you can find a wide spectrum of available packages for your robotics application.\n",

A project can also make use of packages from different workspaces, as long as those workspaces are included in the ROS system path.\n",

    "## ROS workspaces\n",
    "\n",
    "ROS packages can be built as standalone projects, but the natural way to work with them is by integrating them into __*workspaces*__. A ROS workspace is a folder which can contain multiple packages that are combined together to build more complex projects. The packages in a workspace can be built and installed together all at once. In order to deal with workspace and package compilation, we will use __catkin__, which is the official build system of ROS. A build system is responsible for generating _targets_ from raw source code that can be used by an end user. These targets may be in the form of libraries, executable programs, generated scripts, exported interfaces (e.g. C++ header files) or anything else that is not static code. In ROS terminology, source code is organized into __packages__, with each package typically consisting of one or more targets when built. More specifically, catkin builds on top of CMake by combining CMake macros with Python scripts to add functionality beyond CMake's standard workflow. catkin's workflow is very similar to CMake's but it adds support for automatic package discovery and the ability to build multiple interdependent projects simultaneously.\n",

    "\n",
    "+ __Source space:__ It contains the source code of catkin packages. This is where you can extract/checkout/clone source code for the packages you want to build. Each folder within the source space contains one or more catkin packages. This space should remain unchanged by configuring, building, or installing. The root of the source space contains a symbolic link to the catkin's 'toplevel' `CMakeLists.txt` file. This file is invoked by CMake during the configuration of the catkin projects in the workspace and it is created when the workspace is initialized.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ __Build space:__ This is where CMake is invoked to build the catkin packages in the source space. CMake and catkin keep their cache information and other intermediate files here. \n",

These are __first-order__ dependencies of the package; in many cases, a dependency will also have its own dependencies (e.g., `rospy` has other dependencies), so the total list of dependencies of the package will typically be longer. The previous command will create a `beginner_tutorials` folder which contains a `package.xml` and a `CMakeLists.txt`, which are partially initialized.

    "+ `<build_export_depend>` Packages that are needed to build libraries against this package. This is the case when you transitively include their headers in public headers in this package.\n",
    "+ `<depend>` It specifies that a dependency is a build, export, and execution dependency. __This is the most commonly used dependency tag.__\n",
    "+ `<test_depend>` It specifies only additional dependencies for unit tests. They should never duplicate any dependencies already mentioned as build or run dependencies.\n",
    "+ `<buildtool_depend>` It specifies build system tools which this package needs to build itself. Typically the only build tool needed is catkin. __All packages have at least a build tool dependency on catkin.__ \n",
    "+ `<doc_depend>` It specifies documentation tools which this package needs to generate documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you add new dependencies to your packages, apart from updating the `package.xml` file, you should also update `CMakeLists.txt`. Remember that this file tells catkin how to build your package. Therefore, build dependencies must be listed in the `find_package()` macro, in order to find them before compilation. __You should only `find_package` components that are needed at build time, you should not add execution dependencies__. Furthermore, the `catkin_package()` macro may need to be updated. This macro generates CMake config files for your package and it is specifically for building C++ code in other packages which depends on yours. More specifically, the macro specifies header directories and libraries of your package that other dependent projects would need to compile against this package. The `CATKIN_DEPENDS` parameter of the macro should include all the catkin packages that are needed (via their include directories, flags, and libraries) so that other packages that depend on this package compile against this package. In general, ROS `CMakeLists.txt` files contain numerous comments, making them easy to modify according to your specific needs. A detailed explanation of all the `CMakeLists.txt` macros can be found [here](https://wiki.ros.org/catkin/CMakeLists.txt).\n",

    "ROS allows you to record published messages in a `bag` file. You can record messages and play them back later to replicate a certain behavior and debug your nodes. Follow this [tutorial](https://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/Recording%20and%20playing%20back%20data) to learn how to record and replay bag files with the `rosbag` tool. \n",

    "\n",
    "ROS has a quite powerful 3D visualization tool called RViz which can display all types of sensor data published in a ROS system. Note that RViz is just a display for data not a simulator. In fact, it could be used to show information from simulated or real robots, even simultaneously. RViz can be launched calling `rosrun rviz rviz`. \n",

    "In the initial window, the big black thing is the 3D world view (empty because there is nothing to see yet). On the left, you'll see a list of all loaded displays. At the beginning, it just contains the global options and the time view. A display is something that draws something in the 3D world, and has likely some options available in the displays list. An example is a map, a point cloud, a laser scan, a camera image stream, the robot state, etc. Each display has a type which indicates what kind of data this display will visualize, and a unique name. For example, you could have two laser scanners on your robot, and you might create two \"Laser Scan\" displays named \"Laser Base\" and \"Laser Head\".\n",
    "\n",
    "For the moment, we only ran simple simulations with few data. Once you start to play with more complex ROS systems, RViz will become quite useful. You can learn more about how to use it wih the [user's guide](https://wiki.ros.org/rviz/UserGuide).\n",

    "Run a ROS simulation of the Turtlebot3 robot with the command: `roslaunch turtlebot3_gazebo turtlebot3_empty_world.launch`. Then open RViz and add a display to visualize the `/tf` topic. This topic contains the _transform tree_ with all the coordinate frames and their relations. You should set the \"Fixed frame\" to \"odom\" which is a static frame located at the initial position of the robot. In another terminal, run a ROS teleoperation interface to move the robot with the keyboard: `roslaunch turtlebot3_teleop turtlebot3_teleop_key.launch`. You should see frames moving in RViz. "
