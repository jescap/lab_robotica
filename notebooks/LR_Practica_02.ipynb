    "In this notebook, we will go over the basic concepts to code in Python, which is the language we will use to develop our algorithms throughout this course. Python is an interpreted language that is widely spread in science programming. Its main advantages are that: it is easy to learn and adequate for fast application development, due to its high-level data structures and dynamic typing; it is object-oriented and multi-platform; and it comes with a wide range of available libraries for multiple purposes. In particular, we'll learn the following in this practical session:\n",

Thus, if you type `5`, the number will be considered an integer (`int`), unless it is used in an expression where it has to be real (`float`); and typing `5.5` will produce a real number.\n",
